Array Comparison Program (C#)
📌 Description

This is a simple C# console program that:

Takes input for two integer arrays of size 3 each.

Compares every element of the first array with every element of the second array.

Prints values based on the comparison condition.

⚠️ Note: This program does not merge the arrays. It only compares elements and prints values based on which number is smaller.

🧠 What the Program Does

Takes 3 integers from the user for the first array.

Takes 3 integers from the user for the second array.

Uses nested loops to compare each element of the first array with each element of the second array.

If arr[i] < arr1[j], it prints arr[j]
Otherwise, it prints arr1[j].

This results in:

9 comparisons (3 × 3)

Multiple printed values.
